# Simple CRUD To-Do MERN App

This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) To-Do application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the integration and deployment of a MERN application using AWS services such as AWS Lambda, AWS Cognito, API Gateway, and AWS Amplify.

## Features

Users can perform the following actions within the app:
- **Add To-Do Item**: Create new to-do items.
- **Fetch All To-Do Items**: Retrieve and display all existing to-do items.
- **Delete To-Do Item**: Remove specific to-do items.
- **Update To-Do Item**: Modify the details of existing to-do items.

## AWS Services Utilized

### AWS Lambda
The backend of this application is deployed on AWS Lambda, allowing for serverless execution of the backend code.

### AWS Cognito
User authentication and registration are handled by AWS Cognito, providing secure sign-up and sign-in capabilities.

### API Gateway
API Gateway is used to expose the Lambda functions as HTTP endpoints, enabling communication between the frontend and backend.

### AWS Amplify
The frontend is deployed using AWS Amplify, which simplifies the process of hosting and managing the React application.
